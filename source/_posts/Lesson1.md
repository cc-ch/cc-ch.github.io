### Lesson1 
#### A private conversation 

Last week I went to the theatre. I had a very good seat. The play was very intersting. I did not enjoy it. A young man and a young woman were sitting behind me. They were talking loudly. I got very angry. I could not hear the actors. I turned round. I looked at the man and the woman angrily. They did not pay any attention. In the end. I can not bear it. I turned around again. I can not hear a word. I said angrily. 
It's none of you business. The man said rudely. This is a private conversation.
